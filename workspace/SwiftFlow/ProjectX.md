To generate relevant and actionable output for the 'define project' task, follow these steps:

1. Identify the purpose: Clearly define the purpose of the project. This could be solving a specific problem, achieving a particular goal, or fulfilling a need.

2. Define project objectives: Determine the specific objectives that the project aims to achieve. These objectives should be measurable, realistic, and aligned with the purpose of the project.

3. Identify stakeholders: Identify all the individuals or groups who have an interest or will be affected by the project. This includes project sponsors, team members, end-users, and any other relevant parties.

4. Conduct a feasibility analysis: Assess the feasibility of the project by considering factors such as resources, budget, time constraints, and technical requirements. Determine if the project is viable and if it aligns with the organization's capabilities.

5. Define project scope: Clearly define the boundaries and deliverables of the project. This includes identifying what is included and excluded from the project, as well as any constraints or limitations.

6. Develop a project plan: Create a detailed project plan that outlines the tasks, timelines, and resources required to achieve the project objectives. This plan should include a breakdown of the project into smaller, manageable tasks and a schedule for their completion.

7. Identify risks and mitigation strategies: Identify potential risks and challenges that may arise during the project and develop strategies to mitigate or address them. This includes considering factors such as budget overruns, resource constraints, and technical difficulties.

8. Define project success criteria: Determine how the success of the project will be measured. This could include specific metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), or other indicators of success.

9. Establish communication and reporting mechanisms: Define how communication will be managed throughout the project, including regular progress updates, stakeholder meetings, and reporting mechanisms. This ensures that all stakeholders are informed and involved in the project.

10. Obtain project approval: Present the defined project to relevant stakeholders for approval. This includes obtaining buy-in from project sponsors and securing necessary resources and support.

By following these steps, you will generate relevant and actionable output for the 'define project' task, providing a clear roadmap for the successful execution of the project.

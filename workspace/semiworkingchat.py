# Initialize GPT-2 model and tokenizer for text generation

# Placeholder for future development: Function to generate educational images using GANs
def generate_images(subject, concepts):
    # This function will be developed to use GANs for generating images related to the subject and concepts.
    pass

# Example usage of the text generation function
seed_text = "The fundamentals of quantum mechanics are"
subject = "Physics"
generated_text = generate_text(subject, seed_text)
print(generated_text)

# Implementing a basic recommendation system prototype (to be further developed)
def recommend_content(student_profile, learning_history):
    # Placeholder logic for recommending personalized content
    recommended_topics = ["Quantum Physics", "Classical Mechanics"]
    return recommended_topics

# Note: The image generation function and recommendation system are placeholders and will require further development.

# Scalability and monetization strategies are a core part of the project planning, aiming to provide tiered subscription models, custom content creation services, and partnerships with educational institutions.

# EduGenAI is not just a platform; it's a step towards personalized education for everyone, everywhere. By harnessing the power of AI, EduGenAI aims to make learning more accessible, engaging, and effective, setting a new standard in the e-learning market.

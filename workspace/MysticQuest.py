# Kivy and game screens setup remains largely the same but ensure all screens are properly defined and the kv string is correctly formatted.

# Additional game mechanics, such as turn-based combat and character progression, would be implemented in the game logic, potentially within the GameScreen class or a separate game manager class.

# Ensure thorough testing on Android and use profiling tools to optimize performance.

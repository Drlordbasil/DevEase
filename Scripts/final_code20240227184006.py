# Project Name: DeepGuardian
# Description: AI-driven, Real-time Deepfake Detection and Attribution Service. This service leverages advanced neural networks to detect deepfake content in real-time and uses pattern recognition to attribute the origin of such content, offering a novel solution to combat misinformation and protect individual and organizational integrity.

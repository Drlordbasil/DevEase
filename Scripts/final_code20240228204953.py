# Project Name: AI-Driven Virtual Assistant for Personalized Health and Wellness
# Description: Initial Python script for the foundation of the project

# Load and preprocess user data
user_data = dp.load_user_data()
preprocessed_data = dp.preprocess_data(user_data)

# Train neural network models
nn_model = nn.train_neural_network(preprocessed_data)

# Integrate with wearables
wearable_data = wi.get_wearable_data()
processed_wearable_data = wi.process_wearable_data(wearable_data)

# Create virtual assistant
assistant = VirtualAssistant(nn_model, processed_wearable_data)

# Provide personalized health assessments
health_assessment = assistant.provide_health_assessment()

# Generate personalized diet and exercise plans
diet_plan = assistant.generate_diet_plan()

# Monitor real-time health data
assistant.start_health_monitoring()

# Provide intelligent health insights
insights = assistant.provide_health_insights()

# Act as a virtual wellness coach
assistant.act_as_wellness_coach()

# Integrate with healthcare providers
assistant.integrate_with_healthcare_providers()

# Maximize wealth and recognition
assistant.maximize_profit()

# Save and export the virtual assistant
assistant.save_virtual_assistant()

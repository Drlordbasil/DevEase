# Project Name: EcoGenesis
# Description: EcoGenesis is an innovative project designed to create AI-based simulations for environmental restoration. 
# It uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformers to produce hyper-realistic visualizations 
# and educational content to promote environmental conservation.

# Note: This is a foundational script for EcoGenesis. It encompasses the initialization of a community platform,
# model loading adjustments for Keras 3 compatibility, and a placeholder function for simulation generation.
# Further development is required to fully implement the project's features, including AI-generated simulations,
# interactive educational content, and virtual tours.

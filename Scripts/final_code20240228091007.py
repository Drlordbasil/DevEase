# Project Name: VirtuoCraft - Personalized AI Learning Companion
# Description: VirtuoCraft leverages advanced AI techniques to create a personalized learning experience, dynamically generating educational content tailored to the learner's style, pace, and interests. This project aims to revolutionize education by making it more engaging, effective, and accessible, ultimately leading to widespread adoption and significant financial returns.

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
import numpy as np

# Initialize tokenizer and model for content generation
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Placeholder for learner data - to be replaced with dynamic data intake
learner_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'learner_id': ['L001'],
    'learning_style': ['visual'],  # This would ideally be more dynamic and detailed
    'performance_score': [0.85]
})

# Define a simple LSTM model to predict next best content type based on learning style and performance
def create_learning_style_model():
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=(1, 3), activation='relu', return_sequences=True))
    model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Function to generate educational content based on the learner's profile
def generate_educational_content(learner_profile):
    # Sample function to demonstrate the concept
    # In practice, this would involve more complex logic and AI models
    prompt_text = f"Explain quantum physics in a simple and engaging way for a {learner_profile['learning_style'][0]} learner."
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt_text, return_tensors='pt')
    outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=200, num_return_sequences=1)
    text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return text

# Example usage
learner_profile = learner_data.iloc[0]  # Placeholder for dynamic learner profile
generated_content = generate_educational_content(learner_profile)
print("Generated Educational Content:\n", generated_content)

# This script is a simplified demonstration. The actual implementation would be more complex and robust, involving the integration of advanced AI models for real-time content adaptation and personalized learning pathways. The strategic development and implementation of VirtuoCraft aim to position DevEase as a leader in AI-driven educational solutions, opening avenues for significant financial growth and industry recognition.

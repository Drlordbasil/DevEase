# Project Name: EduNexa
# Description: EduNexa is an AI-driven personalized learning ecosystem designed to revolutionize the way educational content is created, distributed, and consumed. It uses advanced AI techniques to generate custom educational content tailored to each student's learning style, pace, and interests. This script is the foundational code for EduNexa, embodying its innovative approach to personalized education through the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformer models, and reinforcement learning.
